# BilBook
In order for BilBook to work, there needs to be a local MySQL database, and there needs to be a database named BilBook in it. A user must be created for the database with the username "BilBook" and password "GjMrQiHBsM". To connect to the database, BilBook uses the "mysql-connector-java-8.0.20.jar" present in our lib folder.

"mail.jar" and "activation.jar" is needed for sending emails.

"jsoup-1.16.1.jar" and "org.json.jar" is needed for pricescraping.

The main method of BilBook is in the BilBook.java class.
